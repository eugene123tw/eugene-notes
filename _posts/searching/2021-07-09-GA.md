### 8 queens problem as an example
The goal of the 8-queens problem is to place 8 queens on a chessboard such that no queen attacks any other.

            Failed case, where the queen at the top-left corner could attack the queen at the bottom-right corner.

There are 2 conditions:
* An **incremental formulation** involves operators to augment the state, starting with an empty state; for the 8-queens problem, this means the action of adding a queen to the state 
* A **complete-state formulation** starts will all 8 queens on the board and move them around to reach the winning condition

In **incremental formulation** we have the following definitions stated:
* States: Any arrangements of 0 to 8 queens on the board is a state
* Initial State: No queens on the board
* Actions: Add a queen to any empty square
* Transition model: Returns the board with a queen added to the specified square.
* Goal test: 8 queens are on the board, and no queen can attack another

In this formulation we have $$64 \times 63 \times \cdots 57 \approx 1.8 \times 10^{14} $$ possible states to investigate. A better formulation would prohibit placing a queen in any square that is already attacked:
* States: All possible arrangements of $$n$$ queens ($$ 0 \leq n \leq 8$$), one per column in the leftmost n columns, with no queen attacking another
* Actions: Add a queen to any square in the leftmost empty column such that it is not attacked by any other queen.
