# Heaps

Heaps are arrays for which `a[k] <= a[2*k+1]` and `a[k] <= a[2*k+2]` for all `k`, counting elements from `0`.

- Tips:
  - Use a heap when **all you care about** is the **largest** or **smallest** elements, and you **do not need** to support fast lookup, delete, or search operations for arbitrary elements
  - A heap is a good choice when you need to compute the `k` **largest** or `k` **smallest** elements in a collection. For the former, use a min-heap, for the latter, use a max-heap

# Heap Libraries and APIs

`heapq` only provides min-heap functionality. If needed to build a max-heap, insert their negative to get the effect of a max-heap using `headp`

- `heapq.heapify(L)`, which transforms the elements in `L` into a heap in-place
- `heapq.nlargest(k, L)`/`heapq.nsmallest(k, L)` returns the `k` largest (smallest) elements in `L`
- `heapq.heappush(h, e)`, which pushes a new element on the heap
- `heapq.heappop(h)`, which pops the smallest element from the heap
- `heapq.heappushpop(h, a)`, which pushes `a` on the heap and then pop and returns the smallest element
- `e=h[0]`, which returns the smallest element on the heap without popping it
