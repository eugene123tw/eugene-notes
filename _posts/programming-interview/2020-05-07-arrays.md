# Arrays

- Objectives:
  - Find a way to use the array itself to **reduce space** complexity to $$ O(1) $$
  - Filling ad array from the front is slow, so see it's possible to **write values from the back**
  - Instead deleting an entry, consider overwritting it
  - Be comfortable with writing code that operates on **subarrays**
  - Becareful with indexing, it's easy to make **off-by-1** errors

### Knowledge

#### Difference between `copy.copy` and `copy.deepcopy`.

[Check this post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/17246744/5978883)

#### [Binary Search for sorted lists](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html)

```python
>>> A = [1, 3, 4, 4, 4, 6, 7]
>>> bisect.bisect(a=A, x=4)  # returns the index + 1 for insert of the rightmost `x` from `a`
5
>>> bisect.bisect_right(a=A, x=4, lo=0, hi=4)  # lo: sublist lower index, hi: sublist higher index
4
```

`bisect.bisect(A, 6)`
