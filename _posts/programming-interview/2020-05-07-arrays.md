# Arrays

- Objectives:
  - Find a way to use the array itself to **reduce space** complexity to $$ O(1) $$
  - Filling ad array from the front is slow, so see it's possible to **write values from the back**
  - Instead deleting an entry, consider overwriting it
  - Be comfortable with writing code that operates on **subarrays**
  - Be careful with indexing, it's easy to make **off-by-1** errors

### Knowledge

#### Difference between `copy.copy` and `copy.deepcopy`.

[Check this post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/17246744/5978883)

#### [Binary Search for sorted lists](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html)

```python
>>> A = [1, 3, 4, 4, 4, 6, 7]
>>> bisect.bisect(a=A, x=4)  # returns the index + 1 for insert of the rightmost `x` from `a`
5
>>> bisect.bisect_right(a=A, x=4, lo=0, hi=4)  # lo: sublist lower index, hi: sublist higher index
4
```

## 2.1 The dutch national flag problem

Suppose 0:red, 1:white, 2:blue represents the color in array `A=[1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 2]`, and the pivot index is 3 (`A[3]=1`). Write a program that all elements less than `A[i]` (the “pivot”) appear first, followed by elements equal to the pivot, followed by elements greater than the pivot. In that sense, `A = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]`

### Method 1

I create a cache `counts` to save the number occurrences of `[0, 1 ,2]`, respectively. Since it is already sorted, we only need to change the array according to `counts`.

```python
def dutch_flag_partition(pivot_index: int, A: List[int]) -> None:
    counts = [0, 0, 0]
    for i in A:
        counts[i] += 1

    begin = 0
    for idx, count in enumerate(counts):
        end = count + begin
        A[begin: end] = [idx] * count
        begin = end
```

## 2. Rotate Matrix

### WIP

## 18. Compute the spiral orderig of a 2D array

### Method 1

The concept is trivial. I created a shift list to control the shifting of the x-axis and y-axis and move left/right/up/down according to the current position and change shifting variables whenever it reaches top/right/bottom/left boundary.

We could observe that the program should move right until it reached the top-right corner, and keep moving downwards till it reached the bottom-right, then move left to the bottom-left corner, and finally going upwards until it reaches the end of the outmost spiral, then it has to step in the inner spiral, changing the boundaries and repeat again.

  <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/demo/spiral.html"></iframe>
</div>

```python
def matrix_in_spiral_order(matrix: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
  if len(matrix) == 0:
    return []
  width = len(matrix[0])
  height = len(matrix)
  if (height == 0) or (width == 0):
    return [value for row in matrix for value in row]

  matrix_size = width * height
  shift = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
  row = col = direction = 0
  flatten = []
  for _ in range(matrix_size):
    flatten.append(matrix[row][col])
    matrix[row][col] = 0
    next_row, next_col = row + shift[direction][0], col + shift[direction][1]
    if (next_row not in range(height) or next_col not in range(width) or matrix[next_row][next_col] == 0):
      direction = (direction + 1) % 4
      next_row, next_col = row + shift[direction][0], col + shift[direction][1]
    row = next_row
    col = next_col
  return flatten
```

### Method 2

I discovered a more elegant way to solve the problem from element python interview.

```python
def matrix_in_spiral_order(square_matrix: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    flatten = []
    for outer in range(len(square_matrix) // 2):
        N = len(square_matrix) - outer
        for i in range(outer, N - 1):
            flatten.append(square_matrix[outer][i])
        for i in range(outer, N - 1):
            flatten.append(square_matrix[i][-1 - outer])
        for i in range(N - 1, outer, -1):
            flatten.append(square_matrix[-1 - outer][i])
        for i in range(N - 1, outer, -1):
            flatten.append(square_matrix[i][outer])
    if len(square_matrix) % 2:
        center = len(square_matrix) // 2
        flatten.append(square_matrix[center][center])
    return flatten
```
